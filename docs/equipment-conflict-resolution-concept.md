# Equipment Conflict Resolution Concept

## Philosophy: "Never Say No to a Gig"

The QUINCY system should always find a way to accommodate equipment needs, even when conflicts arise. Equipment conflicts should trigger **solution workflows** rather than blocking operations.

## Current State vs. Future Vision

### Current Behavior (Blocking)
- ❌ Detect equipment conflicts on specific dates
- ❌ Show toast error message
- ❌ **Block sync operation** - prevents booking
- ❌ User hits dead end - cannot proceed

### Future Vision (Solution-Oriented)
- ✅ Detect equipment conflicts on specific dates  
- ✅ **Allow sync to proceed** (never block)
- ✅ Show conflict resolution dialog with options:

## Solution Types

### 1. Equipment Alternatives (Internal Inventory)
When conflicted equipment is unavailable, suggest similar items from existing inventory:

**Example Conflict:**
- Need: 4x Shure SM58 (have 2x, need 2x more)
- Date: Aug 15, 2025

**Alternative Solutions:**
- 2x Shure SM57 (similar dynamic mic)
- 2x Audio-Technica ATM410 (similar handheld)
- 1x Shure Beta 58A + 1x SM57

**Implementation:**
- Use existing OpenAI suggestion service (`supabase/functions/suggest-equipment/`)
- Match by equipment category/folder (Microphones → Dynamic)
- Filter by availability on conflict date
- Present ranked alternatives with "swap" buttons

### 2. Subrenting (External Providers)
When no internal alternatives exist, source from external suppliers:

**Provider Management:**
- Database table: `external_providers`
  - Company name, contact info, equipment catalog
  - Pricing, lead times, geographic coverage
  - Reliability ratings, preferred status

**Subrenting Workflow:**
- Show estimated costs from known providers
- Generate RFQ (Request for Quote) automatically
- Track external rentals within project budget
- Mark items as "subrented" in event equipment

**Provider Integration:**
- API connections where available
- Manual quote entry for smaller suppliers
- Cost tracking and margin calculations

### 3. Cross-Project Reallocation
When equipment is booked by other QUINCY projects:

**Reallocation Options:**
- Show which projects have the equipment
- Contact project managers for negotiation
- Propose equipment swaps between projects
- Timeline adjustments if flexible

## User Experience Flow

```
1. User syncs equipment → Conflict detected
2. System shows: "Equipment conflicts found (3 items)"
3. Conflict resolution dialog opens:
   ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ Equipment Conflicts - Aug 15, 2025     │
   ├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
   │ 🎤 Shure SM58 (need 4, have 2)        │
   │   ✅ 2x SM57 available (swap?)         │
   │   💰 2x from SoundCorp ($45/day)       │
   │   📞 Contact Project Alpha (has 3x)     │
   │                                         │
   │ 🔌 DI Box Active (need 8, have 6)     │
   │   ✅ 2x DI Passive available           │
   │   💰 2x from AudioRent ($25/day)       │
   │                                         │
   │ [Apply Solutions] [Accept Conflicts]   │
   └─────────────────────────────────────────┘
4. User selects solutions or proceeds anyway
5. Sync completes with chosen resolution
```

## Data Model Extensions

### Equipment Alternatives
```sql
-- Track equipment compatibility for suggestions
CREATE TABLE equipment_alternatives (
  primary_equipment_id UUID REFERENCES equipment(id),
  alternative_equipment_id UUID REFERENCES equipment(id),
  compatibility_score INTEGER, -- 1-10 rating
  notes TEXT
);
```

### External Providers
```sql
CREATE TABLE external_providers (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  company_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  contact_email TEXT,
  phone TEXT,
  website TEXT,
  geographic_coverage TEXT[],
  reliability_rating INTEGER, -- 1-5 stars
  preferred_status BOOLEAN DEFAULT false
);

CREATE TABLE provider_equipment (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  provider_id UUID REFERENCES external_providers(id),
  equipment_category TEXT, -- matches our folder system
  item_name TEXT,
  daily_rate DECIMAL,
  lead_time_hours INTEGER,
  min_rental_days INTEGER
);
```

### Subrented Equipment Tracking
```sql
-- Extend project_event_equipment with subrenting info
ALTER TABLE project_event_equipment ADD COLUMN is_subrented BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;
ALTER TABLE project_event_equipment ADD COLUMN provider_id UUID REFERENCES external_providers(id);
ALTER TABLE project_event_equipment ADD COLUMN subrental_cost DECIMAL;
ALTER TABLE project_event_equipment ADD COLUMN subrental_notes TEXT;
```

## Implementation Priority

**Phase 1: Disable Blocking (Current)**
- Remove conflict blocking from sync operations
- Log conflicts for future analysis
- Allow overbooking to proceed

**Phase 2: Alternative Suggestions**
- Integrate existing OpenAI suggestion service
- Build equipment compatibility database
- Create conflict resolution dialog UI

**Phase 3: Subrenting System**
- Provider management interface
- Cost estimation and RFQ generation
- External rental tracking and billing

**Phase 4: Cross-Project Features**
- Project communication tools
- Equipment reallocation workflows
- Timeline negotiation features

## Business Impact

**Revenue Protection:**
- Never lose gigs due to equipment constraints
- Convert potential losses into subrental opportunities
- Maintain client relationships through reliability

**Operational Efficiency:**
- Automated solution finding reduces manual work
- Provider relationships streamline external sourcing
- Cost transparency enables better project pricing

**Competitive Advantage:**
- "Always yes" capability differentiates from competitors
- Comprehensive equipment access expands serviceable projects
- Professional conflict resolution builds client trust
