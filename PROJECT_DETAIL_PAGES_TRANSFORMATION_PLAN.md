# üéØ Project Detail Pages Transformation Plan

## **Overview**
Transform the project detail pages to fully leverage our enhanced design system and perform comprehensive house cleaning for consistency, accessibility, and polish.

## **üé® Design System Integration Goals**

### **Form Standardization**
- [ ] Apply `FORM_PATTERNS` to all project detail forms
- [ ] Implement `FormDialog` wrapper for all modals/popups
- [ ] Use standardized Norwegian placeholders and validation
- [ ] Ensure consistent currency formatting with `kr` symbol
- [ ] Add contextual icons to all form fields

### **Visual Consistency** 
- [ ] Replace hardcoded colors with design system variables
- [ ] Standardize icon sizing to `h-4 w-4` across all components
- [ ] Apply consistent button patterns from `COMPONENT_CLASSES.button`
- [ ] Use `STATUS_PATTERNS` for project status indicators
- [ ] Implement role badge standardization with `getRoleBadgeClasses()`

### **Layout & Responsive Design**
- [ ] Apply `RESPONSIVE.grid` patterns for card layouts
- [ ] Use `RESPONSIVE.flex` for header and action sections
- [ ] Implement consistent spacing with `RESPONSIVE.spacing`
- [ ] Ensure mobile-first responsive behavior

## **üßπ House Cleaning Tasks**

### **Component Consolidation**
- [ ] Remove duplicate form patterns and consolidate
- [ ] Identify and merge similar dialog components
- [ ] Clean up unused imports and dead code
- [ ] Standardize component naming conventions

### **Code Quality Improvements**
- [ ] Fix TypeScript errors and improve type safety
- [ ] Add comprehensive PropTypes/interfaces
- [ ] Improve error handling and loading states
- [ ] Add proper error boundaries

### **Performance Optimization**
- [ ] Implement proper memo usage for expensive renders
- [ ] Optimize re-renders in form components
- [ ] Lazy load heavy components where possible
- [ ] Review and optimize data fetching patterns

## **‚ôø Accessibility Enhancements**

### **ARIA Implementation**
- [ ] Add `aria-label` attributes to all interactive elements
- [ ] Implement `aria-describedby` for form validation
- [ ] Add `role` attributes for custom components
- [ ] Ensure proper heading hierarchy (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`)

### **Keyboard Navigation**
- [ ] Test and fix tab order throughout detail pages
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- [ ] Ensure modal focus management works correctly
- [ ] Add skip links for screen readers

### **Screen Reader Support**
- [ ] Add `sr-only` text for context
- [ ] Ensure form errors are announced
- [ ] Test with screen reader software
- [ ] Add loading state announcements

## **üìÅ Target Areas & Priority**

### **High Priority**
1. **`src/components/projects/detail/ProjectDetailTabsHeader.tsx`**
   - Tab navigation styling and accessibility
   - Consistent tab state management

2. **`src/components/projects/detail/crew/ProjectCrewTab.tsx`**
   - Crew management forms and dialogs
   - Role badge standardization

3. **`src/components/projects/detail/equipment/`**
   - Equipment selector improvements
   - Drag & drop UX enhancements

### **Medium Priority**
4. **`src/components/projects/detail/ProjectGeneralTab.tsx`**
   - Project info forms
   - Status indicator improvements

5. **`src/components/projects/detail/layout/ProjectLayout.tsx`**
   - Overall page structure
   - Responsive layout patterns

### **Low Priority**
6. **`src/components/projects/detail/ProjectHeader.tsx`**
   - Header action buttons
   - Breadcrumb consistency

## **üîß Implementation Strategy**

### **Phase 1: Foundation (2-3 hours)**
- Start with layout components and tab navigation
- Apply design system patterns to core structure
- Fix any breaking changes early

### **Phase 2: Forms & Dialogs (3-4 hours)**
- Convert all forms to use `FORM_PATTERNS`
- Implement `FormDialog` consistently
- Add proper validation and error states

### **Phase 3: Polish & Accessibility (2-3 hours)**
- Complete accessibility audit
- Fine-tune visual consistency
- Performance optimization pass

### **Phase 4: Testing & Documentation (1-2 hours)**
- Test all functionality thoroughly
- Update component documentation
- Create migration notes if needed

## **‚úÖ Success Criteria**

### **Visual Consistency**
- [ ] All colors use design system variables
- [ ] Consistent icon sizing and positioning
- [ ] Uniform spacing and typography
- [ ] Responsive behavior across devices

### **Functionality**
- [ ] All forms work correctly with new patterns
- [ ] No regressions in existing features
- [ ] Improved error handling and validation
- [ ] Better loading states and feedback

### **Accessibility**
